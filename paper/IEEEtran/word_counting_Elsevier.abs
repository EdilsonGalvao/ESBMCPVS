Energy consumption forecasting growth for the world is $1.3$\% until $2040$, and solar photovoltaic systems had the highest adoption as an alternative for fossil fuels. To improve the optimal sizing of stand-alone systems, we develop an automated formal synthesis technique for stand-alone systems. Our approach, named PVz, is based on the counterexample-guided inductive synthesis; it has a multi-core feature, which can obtain optimal sizing of photovoltaic systems focusing on life cycle cost analysis. Starting with the electrical demands and sizing requirements of a house, our technique seeks a set of electrical equipment to find the best possible combination of devices: a combination of electrical compatibility with the global lowest price, based on a 20-years horizon of operation and maintenance. We present our experimental results based on seven case studies, with typical electrical demands of Amazon basin' houses in Brazil. Targeting to validate and compare our results, we obtained the optimal sizing from a commercial optimization tool for the same case studies and submitted each designed system to a popular simulation tool. Issues like runtime, optimal solution, and configuration of the resulting sized systems were analyzed as well. We conclude that our approach provides more accurate results than existing literature approaches and with impressive time to respond compared with the previous automatic synthesis techniques.
